# NLP at Stanford before the Stanford NLP Group 

The first computational linguistics/NLP faculty at Stanford was 
[Joyce Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Friedman) (1928–2018; at Stanford 1965–1968). She joined Stanford
Computer Science the year the department was founded (although several
CS faculty had been at Stanford earlier in the Department of
Mathematics) and was the first woman on the CS Faculty. However, she
moved in 1968 to the University of Michigan and then later to Boston
University. She was President of the Association for Computational
Linguistics in 1971 (again, as the first female president).

Joyce worked on quite linguistic topics, such as implementing
Chomsky's _Aspects_-era transformational grammar and formal reasoning.

She was the advisor of several people who later became prominent
including David Scott Warren and C. Ray Perrault (who in turn was the
PhD advisor of James Allen).
