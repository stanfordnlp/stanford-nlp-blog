# History of NLP at Stanford and the Stanford NLP Group

## Origins of the group

Christopher Manning was hired in 1999 and came to Stanford for Fall 1999, becoming an Assistant Professor filling a newly created joint faculty position in Linguistics and Computer Science. Here are some early photos of Chris at Stanford, which we think might be from the 1999 CS Department Retreat taken by Héctor García-Molina. The one on the left shows him with Daphne Koller and the one on the right shows Chris, the CS department chair Jean-Claude Latombe, department manager Peche Turner, and Professor Héctor García-Molina.
