# Origins of the Stanford NLP Group

Christopher Manning was hired in 1999 and came to Stanford for Fall
1999, becoming an Assistant Professor filling a newly created joint
faculty position in Linguistics and Computer Science. Here are some
early photos of Chris at Stanford from the Fall 1999 CS Department
Retreat taken by Héctor García-Molina. 


## 1999–2001

The first two Stanford NLP PhD students were Kristina Toutanova and
then Dan Klein.

## 2001–2003

The next PhD students were Sep Kamvar, Roger Levy, Teg Grenager (who
later dropped out), and
then Jenny Finkel (well, she was an MS CS student during this period,
but later a PhD student).

Other students and visiting faculty around the Stanford NLP Group during these early years
were: Mike Jahr, Tolga Ilhan, Mark Chavira, Kristen Parton, Joseph
Smarr, Huy Nguyen, Andrea Toma, Miler Lee, Jim McFadden, Cindi
Thompson, Jeannette Pettibone, and Iddo Lev.
