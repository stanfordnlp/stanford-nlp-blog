# Origins of the Stanford NLP Group

Christopher Manning was hired in 1999 and came to Stanford for Fall
1999, becoming an Assistant Professor filling a newly created joint
faculty position in Linguistics and Computer Science. Here are some
early photos of Chris at Stanford from the Fall 1999 CS Department
Retreat taken by Héctor García-Molina. The one on the left shows him
with Daphne Koller and the one on the right shows Chris, the CS
department chair Jean-Claude Latombe, department manager Peche Turner,
and Professor Héctor García-Molina.
